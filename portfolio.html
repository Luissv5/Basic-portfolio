	 <p>My name is Luis Uribe. I am nineteen years old, and have passion for coding. I fell in love with it when i was a junior in high school. I do it for fun and do enjoy it. I am a Colorado Native, and love it here. There is so much to do and see. I am interested in computers, soccer, nature, and music. I have a lot of interests, but I am in introvert so I do things on my own.</p>

      <p>I listen to all type of music expect for two genres. I can not listen to country or hardcore rock. I listen to rap and instrumental beats. Favorite artist right now has to be Cousin Stizz. I enjoy playing soccer every friday with my friends, just getting a big game going. I used to play for a team when I was younger then I stopped playing for a long time. Now I'm getting back into it again.</p>
